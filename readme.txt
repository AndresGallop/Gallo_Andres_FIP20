Developmetn notes:

This project is my Midterm Fip, it will be constructed with SASS and AJAX for the dynamic content, more specificlly, I will use the fetch
to call data to my webpage.

This first part has all the folders set up, and the design is a wareframe. This first installment is an approach to dynamic content and a bit of javascript for the UX, I will use arrays, functions, strings. For the dynamic content call I will use the ajax fetch method, which would allow me to call data from a JSON file.
The organization of the page styles will be done with SASS, so I will have a more organized page for the developer.  

First Deliver:

October 18.

Second and Final Delivery:

December 2.

Development proccess:

1. Create a database in mySQL for rendering the gallery in the index.html and in the lightbox.
2. Making a fetch call with the AJAX method, also I put a catch error in order to see the status of the expotation.
3.Creating lightbox and make it functions in JS. (Everything was done with Vue.js).
4. The gallery is made of a template and a component from VUe.js.
5. The PHP form is functional, and has some html text converter in order to avoid frauds or mailwares.
6. Docker was used for the comprbation of the PHP form, using localhost:3040 and localhost:8025 as the sender and recepter.
7. JS and CSS were written in modules format.

Difficulties and challenges

I found dificult to connect my database to the hosting, it turns out that when you make the fetch i has to be named to the 
database username and password. It is not root and empty, you have to create and user and pssword for the particular database.
