Developmetn notes:

This project is my Midterm Fip, it will be constructed with SASS and AJAX for the dynamic content, more specificlly, I will use the fetch
to call data to my webpage.

This first part has all the folders set up, and the design is a wareframe. This first installment is an approach to dynamic content and a bit of javascript for the UX, I will use arrays, functions, strings. For the dynamic content call I will use the ajax fetch method, which would allow me to call data from a JSON file.
The organization of the page styles will be done with SASS, so I will have a more organized page for the developer.
